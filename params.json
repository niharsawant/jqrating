You can learn more about Widget Factory on its [wiki page](http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138135/Widget factory). Even though everything is written in preprocessors like Coffeescript and LESS, compiled Javascript and CSS can also be found on respective directories.\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n* value    : _(default : 0)_ assign number of points to be marked as starred\r\n* limit    : _(default : 5)_ maximum number of points one can give\r\n* readOnly : _(default : true)_ decides if plugin mode is readonly or editable\r\n* hints    : _(default : ['Hated it', 'Disliked it', 'It was okay', 'Liked it', 'Loved it'])_ tooltip to be shown on stars from left to right order_\r\n\r\n### Methods\r\n* onrate : invoked when some one rates\r\n\r\n### How to hack\r\nInstead of adding lots of options and increasing size of code, this section depcits how to manipulate with code.\r\n* **Change/Resize Rating Image** : Each star has been assigned `ui-rating-star` class in CSS/LESS. It has properties such as `width`, `height`, `background-size`; feel free to manipulate them according to your convenience. As well as in case of changing star image, selectors such as `ui-rating-starred`, `ui-rating-unstarred`, `ui-rating-disabled` has property `background-image` change it desired image path.\r\n* **Seperate Image for each Star** : Each star has id called `ui-star-rating*n*` where n is index of star. If you wish to assign distinct image to each of such stars, add appropriate selectors with proper index and assign `background-image` to each of them.\r\n* **Custom Tooltips** : I prefer using custom tooltips such as [Tipsy](http://onehackoranother.com/projects/jquery/tipsy/), you can even add custom tooltips for hints. There is a private method called `_setHints` you can add appropriate plugins in that method.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n1.  jQuery v1.8 <\r\n2.  Widget Factory","name":"jQRating"}
